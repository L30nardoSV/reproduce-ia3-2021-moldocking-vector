# Reproducing IA^3 2021 Paper: Mapping Irregular Computations for Molecular Docking to the SX-Aurora TSUBASA Vector Engine

This repository contains the scripts and configuration files used in the 
Artifact Appendix of the aforementioned article submitted to IA^3 2021 **(currently under revision)**.

These scripts automate the evaluation of:
* AutoDock-Aurora on SX-Aurora TSUBASA, as well as 
* AutoDock-GPU on GPUs/CPUs.

## Instructions

1. [AutoDock-Aurora](./USAGE_AURORA.md)
2. [AutoDock-GPU](./USAGE_GPU.md)
